## Abstract 
Regulatory laws to protect user data privacy are enacted across the globe. European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) imposes obligations onto organizations anywhere if they target or collect data related to people in Europe. Organizations have shown more interest in adopting Blockchain technology in their respective domains. The technology guarantees "immutability," but the regulations mandate the technology to ensure "Right to Erasure," making the technology and the solutions built Non-GDPR compliant. In this paper, we formulate a hybrid Blockchain Framework for Healthcare use-case. The proposed architecture integrates both off-chain and on-chain approaches to maintain data protection compliance with GDPR to achieve an effective outcome. A unique identity based on the ERC-721 standard is used to retrieve and verify data mapped and stored in the Ethereum Blockchain using the smart contract. Personally identifiable information is stored in a traditional database, its reference hashes in Blockchain. Similarly, non-personally identifiable information is stored in IPFS, and the reference hashes in Blockchain. Finally, we propose a custom decentralized identity to identify and authenticate users without disclosing any sensitive information.
